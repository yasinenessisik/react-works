## Technologies Used

### React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you create complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called components.

### JSX

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

### Components

Components are the building blocks of a React application's UI. These can be functional or class-based. In this project, we use functional components.

### Props

Props are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.

### State

State is a built-in object that allows a component to create and manage its own data. State can change over time, and whenever it does, the component re-renders.
### `components/Header.jsx`

This file contains the `Header` component which is used to render the header section of the app.

### `components/CoreConcept.jsx`

This file contains the `CoreConcept` component which is used to render each core concept item.

### `components/TabButton.jsx`

This file contains the `TabButton` component which is used to render the tab buttons for selecting different topics.

### `data.js`

This file contains the data used in the app, including the core concepts and examples.

### `App.js`

This is the main file of the application. It uses state to manage the selected topic and renders the header, core concepts, and examples sections.
